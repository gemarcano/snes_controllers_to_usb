These are governed by the LICENSE.raspberrypi license file. In summary,
"Permission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this design for any purpose
with or without fee is hereby granted." There are some exceptions, but I do not
believe we are using any of the models/designs from other manufacturers that
fall under those exceptions.

The KiCAD PCB design files are licensed under the CERN Open Hardware Licence

The software under the firmware folder is licensed under the GPL v2.0 or later,
